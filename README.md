I developed a Python-based facial recognition software using TensorFlow and a Siamese neural network model that I coded from scratch. The software leverages the Siamese model to train on facial images, enabling accurate and efficient recognition by comparing feature vectors of faces. This project demonstrates my ability to work with advanced machine learning frameworks and develop custom neural network architectures.
